# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

The purpose of the repository “kickstarter-analysis” is to store the files used in preforming analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.  I will be using this README.md file to help Carleton people using my GitHub to understand what is here and where to find it.

## Files in the repository

I have created a resource folder to hold the image files that we be in the Challenge report.

- The Excel spreadsheet containing the required tab is labeled Kickstarter_Challenge(Deliverable).xlsx

- There is another Excel Spreadsheet Kickstarter_Challenge(Plus Extractions).xlsx that I used to quickly extract other views of interest

- The final report is in the Markdown file Written_Report_Challenge1.md

- The repository contains a resource folder with the three figures and 2 table that are referenced in the report

- A zip folder of the complete repository can also be found here
